INFO
-------------------------------------------------------
2016  Font created by Walter van Rijn

I have inserted words within the capitals of this digital font. Words which are only readable by us, humans, and not by the computers which use the font. The words relate to the human rights and freedoms as they are formulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948. See http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html for more information.

Human rights are inalienable from every human being. Through this font the Universal Declaration of Human Rights become symbiotically merged within every text. If you use this font your text will include a mini version of the human rights, although the reader might not be aware of it if you use it in normal size (for example 12 points). Only if you use it in large sizes (for example 48 points) the words become readable. 

I felt compelled to create this font because the precarious state of the human rights in the world. My government and your government are very unlikely to improve these rights as they were declared almost 70 years ago. It is down to us to make this happen: use, disperse and promote your human rights with every sentence you write.

Version 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 November 2016
I simplified the name to Being Human and improved kerning. I also added a few glyphs to complete the Turkish alphabet.

"Question 1.1 Can I use the fonts for a book or other print publication, to create logos or other graphics or even to manufacture objects based on their outlines?
Answer: Authors of fonts released under the OFL allow you to use their font software as such for any kind of design work. No additional license or permission is required, unlike with some other licenses."
"Question 1.6: Why won't the OFL let me sell the fonts alone?
Answer: The intent is to keep people from making money by simply redistributing the fonts. The only people who ought to profit directly from the fonts should be the original authors, and those authors have kindly given up potential direct income to distribute their fonts under the OFL. Please honour and respect their contribution!"
